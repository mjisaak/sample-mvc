# Hi! I am Fred

This is a simple ASP .NET Core 6.0 MVC Demo application that you can use to demonstrate e. g. containerization or deployments. The MVC Demo app can be extended with a simple Web API.

## Usage

Just clone this repository, jump into the `src/WebApp` folder and start the application using ```dotnet run```

Or pull the containerized application using ```docker push whiteduck/sample-mvc:latest```
